In the dynamic world of web development, I've spent nearly 15 years coding for a wide array of projects, from ERPs handling hundreds of thousand of requests daily to front-end marvels collaborating with true artists.

My main fields of expertise are PHP, MySQL, JS ES6, CSS3/HTML5. 

With a passion for continuous learning, I've honed my skills in frameworks like Zend, Laravel, and Symfony as well as various CMS like Wordpress, Drupal, Prestashop etc... to craft custom solutions that fit each project.

While I may not claim mastery, I bring a wealth of experience and a genuine passion for problem-solving to the table. 

If you're seeking a reliable partner to transform your digital visions into reality, I'm here to lend my expertise and enthusiasm to your endeavors. Let's embark on this journey together and create something remarkable.
